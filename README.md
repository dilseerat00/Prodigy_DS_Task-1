# Task 1:
**Create a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable, such as the distribution of ages or genders in a population.**

Welcome to my submission for Task 1 of the Data Science Internship at Prodigy Infotech. In this task, I performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset provided, focusing on creating visualizations to represent the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this task is `API_SP.POP.TOTL_DS2_en_csv_v2_3401680` and `Metadata_Country_API_SP.POP.TOTL_DS2_en_csv_v2_3401680` , containing  large set of data/records of population and  distribution income from the year 1960 to 2023.

# Data Visualization of Variable Distribution

This repository provides examples of how to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable using Python libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `pandas`
- `numpy`

You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install matplotlib seaborn pandas
```

## Tools and Libraries Used
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For running the analysis.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Numpy**: For numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
During the EDA process, I performed the following steps:

1. **Data Loading and Inspection**:
   - Loaded the dataset into a DataFrame using libraries like Pandas.
   - Inspected the first few rows to get a sense of the data structure (df.head()).

2. **Data Cleaning**: 
   - Checked for missing values, duplicates, and outliers in the dataset.
   - Handled any issues found to ensure the integrity of the data.

3. **Visualization**:
   - Created bar charts and stacked charts to visualize the distribution of a selected variable (categorical or continuous) within the dataset.

## Conclusion
During the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the world population dataset (1960-2023), several key insights and findings were observed:

1. **Population Trends**:
   - The global population has shown a consistent growth trend over the years in specific regions or countries, indicating areas of high population increase.

2. **Distribution of Population**:
   - The distribution of population across different countries was heavily skewed, with a few countries having significantly larger populations compared to others.
   - Visualizations, such as histograms and bar charts, illustrated the disparities in population sizes.
